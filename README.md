A simple example of a website constructed with SPA web-application without reloading new pages using React Router.

#React-router-dom

Dynamic routing was implemented in a web app by npm package React Router DOM.
404: Page Not Found is also implemented and the route for PageNotFound is provided inside the routing. So if someone tries to send a request to any page that is not present in the routes array then that user is automatically navigated to this PagenotfoundComponent.
